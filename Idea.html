        <h2>Introduction to the Idea</h2>
        <p>
            When you've spent countless hours reading about different yeast or bacterial strains and their life cycles, it's almost inevitable that a thought crosses your mind: "<strong>But is this even true?</strong>" In those moments, you try to summon a bit of faith, sprinkle in a lot of creativity, and just keep reading. Then, occasionally, the stars (or microbial metabolic pathways) align to give you a little wink. That’s exactly what happened the day I first discovered the company Pioreactor. A small, affordable gadget that allowed me to digitally and remotely monitor the microbial growth of the yeasts and bacteria I had been theorizing about for so long. The excitement I felt in that moment was only matched by the first time I peered through a microscope and saw the lemon-shaped cell of Brettanomyces bruxellensis.

        <h2>Fulfilling a need</h2>
        <p>
            Months after having purchased and used the Pioreactor almost frenetically, another question popped into my head... What if I could incorporate more sensors to gather even more data on my microbial cultures? The answer was simply complex: I just needed to increase the diameter of the vial... from 1.5 cm to 8 cm. <strong>How hard could it be to scale a bioreactor from 15 ml to 500 ml?</strong> All the questions and answers that have accompanied (and continue to accompany) me in this project are captured in this logbook, filled with joys, frustrations, and countless milligrams of caffeine.

        <h2>PS70</h2>
        <p>
            The space where this project has been (and continues to be) carried out is the Fabrication Lab at the Science Center. I am deeply grateful to the entire team for their endless patience with me, as about six weeks ago, when I am writing this (Oct. 15, 2024), I didn’t even know things like Fusion, calipers, or even volts existed. Thank you! The Fabrication Lab is what the French anthropologist Marc Augé would call a "place"—that is, <strong>a space filled with curiosity <strong>, where "things" can actually happen.
